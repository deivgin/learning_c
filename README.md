# Exam Prep

I have decided to try my hands at getting masters degree in computer science, [software engineering](https://www.vu.lt/en/studies/master-studies/software-engineering)

To attend I first need to pass an entrance exam, which consists of many CS basics, which I need to either catch up on or learn all together. This repo is for that.
