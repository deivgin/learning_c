## Arithmetics

Polynomial - a mathematical expression consisting of variables and coefficients.
x^2 - 4x + 7
x^3 + 2xyz^2 âˆ’ yz + 1

Matrix - a rectangular array of numbers or tables, symbols or expressions, arranged in rows and collumns that represent a mathematical object

A `term` in mathematics is a combination of a variable and a number, mostly number\*variable = 2x. The variable is one or more variables raised to a power.
The number is called the coefficient.

Polynomial is a combination of terms linked together via addition or subtraction.

We do not need to write 1 in a polynomial, so sometimes we get them like this:
3x^2 + x - 5 = 3x^2 + 1x^1 - 5x^0
